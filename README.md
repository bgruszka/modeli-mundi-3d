### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run the application using one of these methods:

**Method 1: Using Python (Recommended)**
```bash
python3 start_server.py
```
The application will automatically open in your browser.

**Method 2: Using any HTTP server**
```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js http-server (if installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

**Method 3: Direct file access**
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser (may have limitations with some browsers due to CORS policies).

## Educational Content

### Aristotle's Geocentric Model
The earliest systematic model placing Earth at the center, surrounded by concentric crystalline spheres carrying celestial bodies. This model dominated Western thought for nearly 2,000 years.

### Ptolemaic Model with Epicycles
A sophisticated geocentric system using epicycles (small circles) to explain the complex motions of planets, particularly retrograde motion. This model successfully predicted planetary positions and was used for over 1,000 years.

### Copernican Heliocentric Model
A revolutionary shift placing the Sun at the center with planets orbiting in circular paths. This model challenged the Earth-centered worldview and laid the foundation for modern astronomy.

### Galilean Model with Moons
Enhanced the Copernican model by incorporating Galileo's telescopic discoveries, including Jupiter's four largest moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto), which provided strong evidence against geocentric models.

### Kepler's Elliptical Orbits
The most accurate historical model, using elliptical rather than circular orbits based on careful observations of Mars. This model could accurately predict planetary positions and formed the basis for Newton's laws.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
The application follows a modular, object-oriented design:
- `UniverseExplorer` class manages the entire application
- Separate methods for each historical model
- Modular animation system
- Clean resource management

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient geometry reuse
- Optimized rendering pipeline
- Responsive animations
- Memory management for scene switching

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

### Android Compatibility
- Android 5.0+ (API level 21)
- OpenGL ES 2.0 support
- WebGL-enabled WebView

## Development

### Adding New Models
To add a new historical model:

1. Add model info to the `modelInfo` object
2. Create a new button in the HTML
3. Add a case to the `loadModel()` switch statement
4. Implement the `createNewModel()` method
5. Update animations in `updateAnimations()`

### Customization
The application is highly customizable:
- Modify colors, sizes, and speeds in each model method
- Adjust camera settings in `setupScene()`
- Change lighting in `setupLights()`
- Customize UI styling in the CSS

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. Any push to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment.

### Manual Deployment
