# Geometric Objects in Historical Universe Models

This document summarizes the simple geometric objects used in each historical model of the universe within the 3D Explorer application.

## 1. Aristotle's Geocentric Model (384-322 BC)

### Spheres:
- **Central Earth**: Large sphere (radius 3) at the center
- **Celestial Bodies**: Seven spheres for Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
- **Crystalline Spheres**: Wireframe spheres representing the "crystalline spheres" that carry celestial bodies
- **Glow Spheres**: Subtle outer spheres creating a luminous effect around crystalline spheres
- **Fixed Stars Sphere**: Outermost wireframe sphere containing all fixed stars

### Points:
- **Individual Stars**: 200 point objects distributed on the fixed stars sphere

### Visual Features:
- Color-coded wireframe spheres for each celestial sphere
- Enhanced opacity and glow effects for educational clarity
- Proper scaling with inner spheres smaller than outer ones

## 2. Ptolemaic Model with Epicycles (150 AD)

### Spheres:
- **Central Earth**: Large sphere at the center
- **Celestial Bodies**: Spheres for Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn

### Rings:
- **Main Orbit Rings**: Circular rings showing the deferent (main circular path)
- **Epicycle Rings**: Smaller rings showing the epicycles (small circles on which planets move)

### Visual Features:
- Color-coded elements matching each planet's color
- Transparent rings with appropriate opacity for clarity
- Clean geometric representation of epicycle motion

## 3. Copernican Heliocentric Model (1543)

### Spheres:
- **Central Sun**: Large sphere at the center with enhanced glow effect
- **Planetary Spheres**: Six planets orbiting the Sun
- **Moon**: Small sphere orbiting Earth
- **Sun Glow**: Subtle outer sphere creating luminous effect around the Sun

### Rings:
- **Planetary Orbit Rings**: Circular rings for each planet's orbit
- **Moon Orbit Ring**: Small ring around Earth for the Moon's orbit

### Visual Features:
- Color-coded orbit rings matching each planet
- Enhanced Sun visualization with glow effect
- Clean heliocentric arrangement without visual clutter

## 4. Galilean Model with Moons (1610)

### Spheres:
- **All Copernican Elements**: Inherits all spheres from the Copernican model
- **Jupiter's Moons**: Four additional small spheres (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto)

### Rings:
- **All Copernican Rings**: Inherits all rings from the Copernican model
- **Jovian Moon Orbit Rings**: Four small rings around Jupiter for its moons



### Visual Features:
- Detailed representation of Jupiter's four largest moons
- Proper relative sizing and orbital distances
- Color-coded moon orbits

## 5. Kepler's Elliptical Orbits (1609)

### Spheres:
- **Central Sun**: Large sphere at the center
- **Planetary Spheres**: Six planets with elliptical orbits
- **Moon**: Small sphere orbiting Earth
- **Focus Point Markers**: Small spheres marking the empty focus of each ellipse

### Lines:
- **Elliptical Orbit Lines**: Curved lines showing the actual elliptical paths
- **Major Axis Lines**: Lines showing the longest diameter of each ellipse
- **Minor Axis Lines**: Lines showing the shortest diameter of each ellipse
- **Focus Crosses**: Small cross markers at the empty focus points

### Visual Features:
- Mathematically accurate elliptical orbits
- Visible focus points for eccentric orbits (eccentricity > 0.05)
- Color-coded orbital elements
- Proper focus positioning with Sun at one focus

## Universal Elements Across All Models

### Background:
- **Star Field**: 3000 procedurally generated stars with varying colors and sizes
- **Procedural Textures**: Realistic surface textures for all celestial bodies

### Interactive Features:
- **Orbits Toggle**: Hide/show all orbit rings, epicycles, and connecting lines
- **Geometry Toggle**: Hide/show wireframe spheres and construction elements
- **Animation Controls**: Play/pause all celestial motions

### Educational Enhancements:
- **Labels**: Text sprites identifying each celestial body
- **Saturn's Rings**: Detailed ring system with multiple layers
- **Realistic Lighting**: Dynamic lighting system with sun, ambient, and rim lighting
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color schemes across all models
